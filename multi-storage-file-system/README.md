# Multi-Storage FUSE Daemon

The POSIX Multi-Storage Client enables easy adoption of object storage
by applications currently accessing their storage via POSIX. While the
Python variant of the Multi-Storage Client is designed to enable easy
adoption of object storage by Python applications, some appication users
prefer (or are required to) not make such modifications. For that matter,
some applications might not be able to invoke the Python variant as they
are implemented in a different language.

The tool described here utilizes FUSE to provide this POSIX access path
thus enabling easy adoption of object storage while providing a common
set of mechanisms to the Python variant.

## FUSE Daemon Configuration

There are two mechanisms for configuring the POSIX Multi-Storage Client.
As with the Python Multi-Storage Client, there is a `file-based` approach
that will search an ordered sequence of configuration file as described
[here](https://nvidia.github.io/multi-storage-client/user_guide/quickstart.html#file-based).
Alternatively, the POSIX Multi-Storage Client may be invoked with a single
argument that explicitly specifies the path to the configuration file to
be used. In either case, the configuration file may be in `YAML` or `JSON`
format (as indicated by the file's extension (i.e. `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json`).
The complete reference documentation for the configuration file's contents is described
[here](https://nvidia.github.io/multi-storage-client/references/configuration.html).

As may be desireable, such configuration files may prefer to reference
environment variables. Hence, a string setting may contain `$VAR` and/or
`${VAR}` references to such values whereupon evaluation of the setting
will ultimately substitute the environment variable `VAR`'s current value.

As FUSE details often require more fine grained and detailed control,
a MSFS-specific (`MSFS` being an acronym for "Multi-Storage-File-System")
configuration language is also available. This configuration mode is selected
by supplying a top-level key `msfs_version` with a supported version number
(see below).

**Environment Variable Integration:**

When using the mount helper (`mount -t msfs <config> <mountpoint>`),
the `MSFS_MOUNTPOINT` environment variable is automatically set and takes precedence over the
`mountpoint` setting in the configuration file. This allows the same configuration file to be
mounted at different locations. The `MSC_CONFIG` environment variable is similarly set with the
path to the configuration file being used.

The MSFS-specific global (i.e. "top-level") settings are described in the following table:

| Setting                         | Units                |                  Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

As noted in the above table, the `backends` setting defines an array of object
store backends to be presented as pseudo-directories underneath the `mountpoint`.
While existing `backends` may not be modified, they can be removed and/or others
added. Changes to the configuration file will be read if a SIGHUP is received.
It is also possible to configure a periodic check for changes to the configuration
file as well. In any event, each `backend` is described in an array element of
the `backends` array as described by settings in the following table:

describe the `backup_type`-specific settings.

### AIStore Backend

If `backend_type` is specificd as "AIStore", a sub-section of the `backend`
configuration (whose name is `AIStore`) may be provided. The AIStore-specific

configuration (whose name is `S3`) must be provided. The S3-specific
settings must be provided (or the defaults accepted) as described in
the following table:

### Configuration Example

Here is an eample (taken from `./msfs_config_dev.yaml`) YAML-formatted configuration file:
```
msfs_version: 1
backends: [
  {
    dir_name: minio,
    bucket_container_name: dev,
    backend_type: S3,
    S3: {
      region: us-east-1,
      endpoint: "http://minio:9000",
      access_key_id: minioadmin,
      secret_access_key: minioadmin,
    },
  },
  {
    dir_name: ais,
    bucket_container_name: dev,
    backend_type: S3,
    S3: {
      use_config_env: true,
      use_credentials_env: true,
    },
  },
]
```

Notice the following:
* The internal configuration format is selected by setting `msfs_version` to `1`
* The `mountpoint` is not specified, so will be the non-empty value of MSFS_MOUNTPOINT ENV or simply `/mnt`
* There are two backends: `minio` and `ais`
  * These will appear as subdirectories under the mountpoint (e.g. `/mnt/minio` and `/mnt/ais`)
  * Each maps to an S3 bucket named `dev`
  * The `minio` backend explicitly specifies the `region` and `endpoint`:
    * The `region` is set to `us-east-1`
    * The `endpoint` is set to `http://minio:9000`
  * The   minio  backend explicitly specifies the   access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`:
    * The `access_key_id` is set to `minioadmin` (the default MinIO `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`)
    * The `secret_access_key` is set to `minioadmin` (the default MinIO `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
  * The `ais` backend enables fetching the `region` and `endpoint` values from the environment:
    * This mode is triggered by setting `use_config_env` to `true`
    * The values for `region` and `endpoint` are fetched from the `${HOME}/.aws/config` file
    * The location of the `config` file could have been adjusted by setting AWS_CONFIG_FILE ENV
    * Since `config_credentials_profile` was not specified, those values come from the `[default]` profile
  * The `ais` backend enables fetching the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` values from the environment:
    * This mode is triggered by setting `use_credentials_env` to `true`
    * The values for `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are fetched from the `${HOME}/.aws/credentials` file
    * The location of the `credentials` file could have been adjusted by setting AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE ENV
    * Since `config_credentials_profile` was not specified, those values come from the `[default]` profile
* All other settings utilized the various defaults specified above

## Docker Development Environment

To facillitate a common developer and testing experience, a Docker Container
environment is provided via a `Dockerfile`. As it is also useful to utilize
a controlled environment for holding the objects to be presented via POSIX,
a `docker-compose.yaml` is also provided that launches a Docker Container
running a Minio S3 object server (`minio`) along with the Development (`dev`)
Docker Container.

A typical development sequence is depicted in the following:

| Host Commands                    | `dev` Container Commands                                                       | Description                                                                                                 |

## Mount Helpers

After installation (`sudo make install`), use standard Unix `mount` and `umount` commands:

### Mounting

```bash
# Mount MSFS filesystem with config file and mountpoint
mount -t msfs /path/to/config.yaml /mnt/msfs1

# Mount multiple instances with different configs or mountpoints
mount -t msfs /path/to/config1.yaml /mnt/msfs1
mount -t msfs /path/to/config2.json /mnt/msfs2
```

### Unmounting

```bash
# Unmount specific mountpoint
umount /mnt/msfs1

# Unmount another mountpoint
umount /mnt/msfs2
```

### How It Works

The `mount` command uses a standard Unix convention: when you specify `-t <type>`, it looks for a helper script at `/usr/sbin/mount.<type>`. For MSFS:

- `mount -t msfs <config> <mountpoint>` → automatically calls `/usr/sbin/mount.msfs`
- The mount helper sets environment variables and launches the `msfs` daemon

**Important: Standard `mount` Command Behavior**

The `mount` command behaves differently depending on the arguments provided:

- **`mount`** (no args) → Lists all currently mounted filesystems
- **`mount -t msfs`** (type only) → Lists all currently mounted MSFS filesystems (does NOT call `mount.msfs`)
- **`mount -t msfs <config> <mountpoint>`** → Calls `/usr/sbin/mount.msfs` to perform the mount

The mount helper (`mount.msfs`) is **only invoked when you provide both the config file and mountpoint**. This is standard Unix `mount` behavior, not a limitation. The helper validates that both arguments are provided before attempting to launch `msfs`

This is the same mechanism used by other filesystems like NFS (`mount.nfs`), CIFS (`mount.cifs`), and FUSE (`mount.fuse`).

**Mount Helper (`mount.msfs`):**
- Exports `MSC_CONFIG` environment variable from the config file argument
- Exports `MSFS_MOUNTPOINT` environment variable from the mountpoint argument
- Creates log directory if needed (`/var/log/msfs/`)
- Launches `msfs` daemon in the background using `setsid` for proper process management
- Stores process ID and mountpoint in `/var/log/msfs/msfs_*.pid` for tracking
- Returns once the daemon is running

**Environment Variables:**
- `MSC_CONFIG`: Path to the configuration file (set by mount command)
- `MSFS_MOUNTPOINT`: Mount point path (set by mount command, overrides config file)
- `MSFS_BINARY`: Path to msfs binary (default: `/usr/local/bin/msfs`)
- `MSFS_LOG_DIR`: Log directory (default: `/var/log/msfs`)

**Unmount Helper (`umount.msfs`):**
- Finds all running msfs processes
- Terminates each process with SIGTERM (waits up to 10 seconds)
- If still running, sends SIGKILL
- Handles zombie processes gracefully (accepts as success)
- Cleans up all PID files in `/var/log/msfs/`
- Note: Unmounts **all** MSFS filesystems, regardless of how many are mounted

### Environment Variables

- **`MSC_CONFIG`**: Path to MSFS configuration file (YAML or JSON)
  - Automatically set by mount helper from the first argument to `mount -t msfs`
  - Passed to the `msfs` binary for configuration loading
- **`MSFS_MOUNTPOINT`**: Mount point path
  - Automatically set by mount helper from the second argument to `mount -t msfs`
  - Overrides the `mountpoint` setting in the configuration file
- **`MSFS_BINARY`**: Path to msfs binary (default: `/usr/local/bin/msfs`)
- **`MSFS_LOG_DIR`**: Directory for logs and PID files (default: `/var/log/msfs`)

### Automatic Mounting with /etc/fstab

MSFS filesystems can be automatically mounted at boot time by adding entries to `/etc/fstab`:

```fstab
# MSFS filesystem with S3 backend
/etc/msfs/s3-config.yaml  /mnt/s3-data  msfs  defaults,_netdev  0  0

# MSFS filesystem with local config
/home/user/msfs.json      /mnt/storage  msfs  defaults,noauto   0  0
```

**fstab field explanation:**
- **Field 1**: Path to MSFS configuration file (YAML or JSON)
- **Field 2**: Mount point directory
- **Field 3**: Filesystem type (`msfs`)
- **Field 4**: Mount options (comma-separated)
  - `defaults`: Standard mount options
  - `_netdev`: Wait for network before mounting (for remote storage)
  - `noauto`: Don't mount automatically at boot (mount manually with `mount /mnt/storage`)
  - `user`: Allow non-root users to mount (requires `allow_other` in config)
- **Field 5**: Dump frequency (usually `0`)
- **Field 6**: fsck pass number (usually `0`)

After editing `/etc/fstab`, test the configuration with:
```bash
sudo mount -a  # Mount all filesystems in fstab
```

### Configuration

The mountpoint is defined in the configuration file's `mountpoint` setting (default: `/mnt`). The filesystem name displayed in `df` and `mount` output is controlled by the `mountname` setting (default: `msfs`).

### Publication

Inside the `dev` container, one may type the following to produce `.deb` and `.rpm`
packages for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures:

```
make deb-packages rpm-packages
```

To actually create .tar.gz and .zip assets:

```
make assets
```

Those assets include `msfs_install.sh` and `msfs_uninstall.sh` scripts automating the process for installing and uninstalling the appropriate package for the platform.
